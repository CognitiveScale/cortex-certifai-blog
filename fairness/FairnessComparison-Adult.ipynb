    "A Disparate Impact Ratio of less than .8 is generally considered to be unfair (but this is somewhat arbitrary), so this model would be considered unfair by that measure. However, Disparate Impact does not take into account the ground truth of the data, which can be problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Equal Opportunity Difference should be 0 to be considered completely fair. A negative value of the Equal Opportunity Difference means the model is correctly predicting the privileged class who received favored outcome more often than it is correctly predicting the unprivileged class. However, there isn't a hard threshold for when the difference is unfair. However a discrepancy of .2 between the true positive rates seems to indicate the model is not being fair to the women who are defined by the ground truth to receive the favorable outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the Burden Index is 74.917. The Burden Index, which takes on values between 0 and 100, is a Gini-like index that measures the disparity between the `Group details` of the different groups. A low value means that the distance between the observations and their counterfactuals for at least one group is much higher than the other groups. This means it's much harder for them to change their features to gain the favorable prediction. Like the Equal Opportunity Difference, there isn't a hard threshold where models with a Burden Index below that value would be considered unfair,  but model developers can use it to compare models without needing to know the ground truth. This is useful in a production settings where ground truth does not exist, and unlike Disparate Impact, the Burden Index takes in to account some notion of \"worthiness\" given the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While none of the measures give us a definitive idea of whether or not the model is fair (because it depends on your definition of fairness), they do all say that the model is favoring the privileged group over the unprivileged group. Looking at this, I would say we as model developers should figure out how to do a better job at predicting which women will make more than $50k per year (and we as humans should figure out how to dismantle and reconfigure power structures so all groups have a fairer shot of achieving the outcomes they want).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, which metric should we focus on? Typically there is no right answer: they all tell us something about our model's fairness. Disparate Impact operationalizes the idea of fairness that all groups should be equally likely to have a favorable prediction of the model, but on an individual level, it can be unfair because it does not mean that a \"better\" individual will get the favorable prediction from the model. Equal Opportunity addresses this issue by looking at the people who are \"good enough\" in the eyes of the world (defined as those people who had the positive outcome in the ground truth) and desiring that those people be equally likely to receive the favorable prediction from the model. However, Equal Opportunity has no concept of how hard it would be for certain groups to change their prediction from unfavorable to favorable, which is where the Burden Index comes in. A model could have an Equal Opportunity Difference of 0 and yet 1) it could be nearly impossible for one group to change their features enough to gain the favorable prediction, and/or 2) very few people in one group in the ground truth have the favorable outcome but the model could be predicting on this small group correctly, which doesn't seem great either. The Burden Index will illuminate both of these points and give a more comprehensive view of the fairness of the model."
